# Pi_Pico_Robot_Code

This project is intended to create a working example of a SMARS robot using a Raspberry Pi Pico using MicroPython(and possible CircuitPython) in leui of an Arduino Uno and cpp.

The majority of this work is referencing cpp libraies already available for the Arduino UNO. MicroPython being inherently slower than cpp, this is not a direct port of the cpp libraries. Additional work toward multi threading is/will be included.
